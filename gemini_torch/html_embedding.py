HTML Parsing and Representation:

    Choose a parser: Select a suitable HTML parsing library (e.g., BeautifulSoup, lxml) to extract relevant information.
    Define representation: Decide how to represent HTML elements and structure (e.g., tokens, trees, graphs). Consider combining textual and structural information.
    Implement parsing and representation functions: Create functions to handle HTML inputs and generate appropriate representations.

2. HTML Embedding Module:

    Create a new class HtmlToEmbeddings:
        Take HTML as input (parsed representation).
        Process it to create embeddings (tensors) aligned with the transformer's dimensionality.
        Reshape the output to match the expected input format for the forward method.
    Experiment with embedding techniques:
        Explore existing text embedding methods (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for text content.
        Consider structural embeddings for HTML elements and relationships.
        Research multimodal embeddings if combining text, images, and HTML.

3. Model Integration:

    Add HTML input to forward method:
        Check for html input alongside text, img, and audio.
        Process HTML using HtmlToEmbeddings.
        Concatenate embeddings with other modalities for multimodal processing.

Example Code Structure:
Python

class HtmlToEmbeddings(Module):
    # ... (Implementation for HTML parsing and embedding)

class Gemini(Module):
    # ... (Existing code)

    def forward(self, text: torch.Tensor, img: torch.Tensor = None, audio: torch.Tensor = None, html: torch.Tensor = None):
        try:
            # ... (Existing code)

            # Handle HTML input
            if exists(html):
                html = self.html_to_embeddings(html)  # Process and create embeddings
                x = torch.concat((text, img, audio, html), dim=1)  # Concatenate with other modalities

            # ... (Existing code)

        except Exception as e:
            # ... (Exception handling)

Additional Considerations:

    Training Data: Collect a dataset with HTML-based phishing examples for model training.
    Computational Costs: Evaluate HTML processing overhead and adjust model complexity if needed.
    Experimentation: Explore different parsing, representation, and embedding techniques to find the most effective approach for your specific task.
